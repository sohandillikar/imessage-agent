#### Reflection

It sounds like you faced a challenging situation with the UC Davis dining hall menu change, but you turned it into an opportunity to improve your skills. You managed to build a new, cleaner, and more reliable web scraper in just a couple of hours, which is a significant achievement. Learning about SQL injections and identifying potential vulnerabilities in your code shows your dedication to improving your projects.

Balancing multiple projects and responsibilities can be overwhelming, especially with the added pressure of upcoming school commitments. It might help to prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance, allowing you to focus on what truly matters. Remember to carve out some time for yourself, even if it's just a short workout, to maintain your well-being amidst your busy schedule.

Key Insight:

Unexpected challenges can lead to improved skills and more reliable solutions.

#### Entry

**Rosebud:** ðŸŒ¹ What's one win, small or big, you had today?

**Sohan Dillikar:** Well today UC Davis changed up their dining hall menu website so my web scraper for my AggieMenus project didn't work anymore. As much as that sucked, I'm really glad I was able to build a brand new one which was cleaner than the old, in less than like 2 hours. I did some hefty prompt engineering there and this new scraper seems a lot more reliable too. Because this was unexpected, I wasn't able to close all the issues on the AggieWorks repo. There's just one more left which is patching up any areas for potential SQL injections. I didn't know what a SQL injection was at first and it sounded pretty complicated to me when I first heard about it but today I learned what it was and it wasn't very complicated at all. As a matter of fact, I found it quite interesting because I never saw this weakness in my code ever. And there were so many potential areas for SQL injections in my AggieMenus code. So to sum it up, I'm glad that today I created a cleaner and more reliable web scraper for the new dining commons menu and I'm glad I learned what a SQL injection was.

**Rosebud:** ðŸ¥€ What's been a source of stress for you today?

**Sohan Dillikar:** Today's stress is coming from the many things that I want to do/work on/accomplish. Some of which include:

1. Automating Nitin's order management workflow for Davis Curry Club
2. Planning out/creating a new website for Davis Curry Club
3. Working on my iMessage Agent project
4. Preparing for tomorrow's hackathon
5. Patching all areas for SQL injections in the AggieMenus repository
6. Creating a marketing plan for the Cattlelog Chrome Extension I built
7. Preparing for the AggieWorks product showcase
8. Working out

I feel like I don't have enough time in my days to work on everything and I hate it. I especially hate the fact that I've been skipping working out daily. This Sunday I'm going to Lake Tahoe with some friends till Tuesday and unfortunately school starts Wednesday and I'll no longer have the time to work on things that I'm passionate about. That worries me.

**Rosebud:** ðŸŒ± What new idea or opportunity emerged today?

**Sohan Dillikar:** A new idea that emerged today was developing a plan to automate Nitin's curry club order management workflow. Basically he currently downloads customer orders from Jotform, feeds it to his Python script on Repl.it, pastes the output into a WhatsApp message that he sends to his Mylapore friend, and finally sends all the customer orders to Saanvi. I want to try to streamline this process for him. Additionally I was thinking of creating a website for Davis Curry Club but I feel like that would just be more steps for the user.
