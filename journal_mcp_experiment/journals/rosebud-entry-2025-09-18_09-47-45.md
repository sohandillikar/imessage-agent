#### Reflection

It sounds like you're juggling a lot of priorities, from closing GitHub issues to preparing for a hackathon and maintaining your workout routine. It's understandable to feel a bit anxious about contributing to a team project for the first time, especially when you're still getting familiar with AI technologies. 

Balancing these tasks can be challenging, but breaking them down into smaller, manageable steps might help you feel more in control. Consider setting specific times for each task, including your workout, to ensure you make progress without feeling overwhelmed. You've got a lot on your plate, but your determination to see your projects through is commendable.

Key Insight:

Balancing multiple priorities requires breaking tasks into manageable steps.

#### Entry

**Rosebud:** üåπ What's your highest priority today?

**Sohan Dillikar:** I want to close all the GitHub Issues on the AggieMenus repository so that AggieWorks will let me host it. I want my AggieMenus project to be live ideally by next week but at latest, it should be live before the AggieWorks product showcase. I hoping the same for my Cattlelog Chrome Extension too.

**Rosebud:** ü•Ä Is there anything worrying you about the day ahead?

**Sohan Dillikar:** Not really. I guess I am a little worried about the hackathon I'm going to tomorrow because it'll be my first time contributing with a team on a project and I don't want to let anyone down. I'm also very unfamiliar with a lot of AI related terms and technologies so I should definitely familiarize myself with them before tomorrow. Only other thing besides that, which is worrying me is the thought of me getting lazy and skipping my daily workout today. I haven't worked out in so long and I constantly feel bloated and I hate it. I don't wanna miss another workout again.

**Rosebud:** üå± What part of today are you most looking forward to?

**Sohan Dillikar:** I'm looking forward to finishing up these AggieMenus issues and moving on to something new. I want to spend more time on my iMessage Agent project and I should probably also start preparing for tomorrow's hackathon. But basically I can't wait to finish AggieMenus and move on.
