#### Reflection

It sounds like you had a mixed experience at the hackathon, feeling both proud of your team's achievement and frustrated with the event's structure. You managed to find value in the day by securing second place and enjoying the social aspect, which helped make the experience worthwhile despite your initial skepticism.

Your reflection on teamwork and the realization that hackathons might not enhance engineering skills but offer networking opportunities is insightful. Embracing the chance to collaborate and connect with others, like you did with Amogh, could open new doors and enrich your future experiences.

Key Insight:

Hackathons offer networking opportunities despite not enhancing engineering skills.

#### Entry

**Rosebud:** üåπ What was the highlight of your day?

**Sohan Dillikar:** Well today was the day. The day of the MCP AI Agents Hackathon at the AWS Builders Loft. And I'm very proud to say that my team and I got second place for best use of Gladia! Which is a speech recognition software. I'm very happy about this because at least the day didn't go to waste. I already think that hackathons are stupid and a waste of time because they don't make you a good engineer but to top it off, it would have sucked if I didn't even get anything out of the event. Because it's not like I was going to gain any knowledge from it. Additionally the inner competitiveness is satisfied to have contributed more to a project than Abhi and have won too. It was also cool how we met Amogh at the hackathon. We ended up spending our entire evening with him by having dinner at "The Bird" and some sort of Ghirardelli treat at the Ghirardelli store nearby.

**Rosebud:** ü•Ä What was challenging for you today?

**Sohan Dillikar:** I guess the most challenging part for me today was learning how to work as a team. I spent the beginning of the hackathon trying to do everything myself because I don't know how to collaborate on code. I eventually gave up after doing some stupid vibe coding. I guess I also wanted to prove myself because this was kind of my opportunity to show everyone can I can code too and I'm a better engineer than they are. So it was kind of an ego thing which really backfired. Eventually though, we ended up working together by splitting the tasks reasonably between me, Savir, Preetham, and Chin Abhi.

**Rosebud:** üå± What's something new or interesting that you learned today?

**Sohan Dillikar:** Something new I learned today was how poor quality hackathons are and having several hackathon wins does not make you a good engineer. Today kind of solidified this belief for me since I realized hackathons just consist of vibe coding because of the time constraint people are kept under. As a result they don't actually follow good coding practices or care about sustainability. But at the same time I realized that there might be networking opportunities at these hackathons. If I go to them like Amogh (solo) and team up with new people then I could certainly learn something new and make new connections. I just need to be willing to do that.
