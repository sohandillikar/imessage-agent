## About

I'm building an AI to understand me, my life, and feelings so well, that it can respond to my texts on iMessage **EXACTLY** like me.

## Data Sources

- **iMessage conversations** - For fine-tuning and understanding my texting style
- **Journal entries** - For sentiment analysis + understanding my thoughts, feelings, and daily activities/events
- **Family/friends context** - Detailed profiles that are modified as the AI learns more about a person
- **LinkedIn profile data** - Additional background context for better understanding of a person
- **Google Calendar + Tasks** - For understanding my schedule/priorities
- **24/7 location data** - Extra context for enhanced web search results

## Capabilities

Beyond just impersonating me, this agent can:

### Calendar Management

- Add tasks and events to my Google Calendar as plans are being made in chats
- Understand availability and scheduling constraints

### Learning & Memory

- Learn from my friends' likes, dislikes, and choices to understand them better
- Save important information to its memory for future reference
- Build contextual understanding of relationships and preferences
